#tuple data structure
#tuple can store any data type
#most important tuples are immutable, once tuple is created you can't update 
#data inside tuple

example = ("one","two","three")
# no append, no insert, no pop, no remove
day = ('monday','tuesday')
 #tuples are faster than list
 
 #methods
 #count,index
 #len function
 #slicing
print(example[:2])
